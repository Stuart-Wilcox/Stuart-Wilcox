Hi my name is Stuart Wilcox, I'm a web developer with 2 years professional experience. I'm more focused on front-end development because I love React, but more recently I have picked up React-Native to compliment my web dev skills with some mobile skills.

Graduated Software Engineering at Western University in 2019, currently working at Deloitte. During my studies, I did two summer internships at London Hydro and IBM.
