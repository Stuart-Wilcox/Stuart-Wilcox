Hi my name is Stuart Wilcox, I'm a full-stack web developer with 2 years professional experience. I'm more focused on front-end development because I love React, but more recently I have picked up React-Native to compliment my web dev skills with some mobile skills. I also have experience working on backends in python/django and node.js/express. Check out my resume linked above to learn more!
